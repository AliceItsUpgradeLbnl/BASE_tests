Rules:

1. No common naming rules will be used.
2. However try to adopt and consistently use your naming rules where possible (e.g. do not name a file adcBoardTestScript and another file dut_board_test_scripts)
3. Keep your code as clean as reasonably possible avoiding unnecessary comments or blocks of commented code, to make it possibile for the other collaborators to understand it
4. Use proper indentation
5. Try to use explicit names for variables and functions (e.g. not "w" for word) unless their scope is very limited (for loop)
6. Don't add *~ files (backup created while modifying a file) to the repository
